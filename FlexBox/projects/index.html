            Krishna was born in the small town of Mathura, ruled by a very cruel king Kamsa- a man so filled with evil that he had his own father imprisoned to grab the throne. 
            When a divine voice prophesied Kamsa’s doom at the hands of Devaki and Vasudeva’s eighth child on the day of their wedding, Kamsa imprisoned the couple and killed their babies one by one as soon as they were born. 
            Devaki and Vasudeva managed to save their seventh, also a miracle child who got transferred to Rohini’s womb. He was Balarama, the older brother of Krishna.
            The eighth child was born on a moonless night. Thunder, lightning, and violent storms witnessed His birth. Immediately after, as if by miracle, Vasudeva found the locked gates open up and the guards deep asleep. 
            Guided by a Divine voice, Vasudeva carried the infant in a wicker basket over his head and waded across the river Yamuna to Nanda’s house in Gokula.

                Lord Ganesha is called the god of knowledge and wisdom and there is a spectacular story that illustrates why it is so.
                Ganesha had a younger brother called as Karthikeya. Both would get along well but, just like all other siblings, they would have moments of arguments and fights. 
                On one such day, Ganesha and Karthikeya both ended up finding a unique fruit in the forest and grabbed it together. 
                They refused to share it with each other and started claiming the fruit for themselves.
                When they reached Mount Kailash and presented this predicament to Shiva and Parvati, Shiva made a proposition. 
                He recognized the fruit and said that this fruit is known to grant immortality and extensive knowledge when eaten by the rightful bearer of it. 
                To choose who gets it, Shiva proposed a challenge. He asked Ganesha and Karthikeya to circumvent their world 3 times. Whoever would do so first and return to Mount Kailash, 
                would be the rightful owner of the fruit.

                    Shiva is the third god in the Hindu triumvirate. The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, upkeep and destruction of the world. The other two gods are Brahma and Vishnu.
                    Brahma is the creator of the universe while Vishnu is the preserver of it. Shiva's role is to destroy the universe in order to re-create it.
                    Hindus believe his powers of destruction and recreation are used even now to destroy the illusions and imperfections of this world, paving the way for beneficial change. According to Hindu belief,
                    this destruction is not arbitrary, but constructive. Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements.
                    Shiva is known to have untamed passion, which leads him to extremes in behaviour. Sometimes he is an ascetic, abstaining from all wordly pleasures. At others he is a hedonist.
